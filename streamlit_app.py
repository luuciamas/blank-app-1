             Across all the methods tested, some core predictors are: age, systolic blood pressure, prevalent coronary heart disease, and sex. Age is a strong indicator of death due to several biological reasons. The other high predictors might be related to a higher risk of developing a CVD.
             Some features that rank low are smoker status and heart rate. 
             Even if smoke status ranks low, the number of cigarettes smoked per day ranks mild-high for all the models. 
             For this reason, it was decided not to exclude it. 
             Regarding heart rate, this parameter could be excluded but it was decided to keep this value, as there are not many predictors and it is not an invasive measurement.

        This research aimed to understand to what extent baseline health indicators can predict all-cause death. 
        To answer this research question, a subset of the initial dataset was created and data exploration and cleaning were performed. 
        Several models were used to predict death. The best model was Support Vector Machine with the top 15 wrapper features. It achieved a cross-validated ROC AUC of 0.7972 and a macro F1 score of 0.7078.
        The discriminative performance of this model is low and it can't be used in clinical settings.
        It is possible to conclude that the baseline health indicators alone are not sufficient to predict all-cause death.
